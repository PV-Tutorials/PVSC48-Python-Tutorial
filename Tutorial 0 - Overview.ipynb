Python is becoming one of the scientific languages of choice, and many open-source tools are available for PV modeling. This tutorial will focus on teaching attendees PV modeling in python through the use of PVlib. \n",

    "In this interactive tutorial we will go from getting acquainted with some common data used or measured in pv systems (i.e. weather), to modeling the AC energy output of a single-axis tracker system. This includes learning and simulating sun position, plane of array irradiances, temperature models, single-diode models and more. \n",

In case it's not obvious, a computer <b> is </b> required.  \n",
